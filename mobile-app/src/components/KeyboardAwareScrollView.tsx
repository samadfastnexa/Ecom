/**
 * A ScrollView that keeps the focused input above the keyboard.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT built on KeyboardAvoidingView. That component shrinks its
 * own height, which is only correct when the OS has *not* already resized the
 * window — and with `android.edgeToEdgeEnabled` you cannot rely on either
 * answer. Guessing wrong shrinks the viewport twice and leaves a dead strip of
 * background above the keypad.
 *
 * This works the other way round, and cannot produce that artefact:
 *
 *   1. It adds the keyboard's height as *padding inside the scroll content*.
 *      Extra padding is always scrollable space, never a gap in the layout, so
 *      it is harmless whether or not the window also resized.
 *   2. It measures the focused input's real position on screen and scrolls it
 *      up by however much the keyboard overlaps it. Screen coordinates are true
 *      under either behaviour, so no assumption about resizing is needed.
 *
 * No new dependency: react-native-keyboard-controller would be the heavier
 * answer, but it is a native module and would break Expo Go.
